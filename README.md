# BASA: Bot for Automated Semantic Assistance

BASA is an internal chatbot for the Philippine Department of Economy, Planning and Development (DEPDev), built with Laravel and powered by local LLMs via Ollama. It provides professional, context-aware answers to agency-related questions, and features a modern, user-friendly chat interface.

## Features
- Modern, responsive chat UI (ChatGPT-style)
- File upload and document parsing for PDF, DOCX, XLSX, and other formats
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) powered by `nomic-embed-text` for semantic chunk search
- Animated loading indicator and retry on failure
- Auto-streaming support for real-time token responses
- Background queue processing for large documents
- Notifications when file processing completes (via events/broadcasting)
- System prompt and context injection for accurate, professional answers

## Supported File Types
- `.pdf` (via `smalot/pdfparser`)
- `.docx`, `.doc`, `.odt`, `.rtf` (via `phpoffice/phpword`)
- `.xlsx`, `.xls`, `.csv` (via `phpoffice/phpspreadsheet`)
- `.txt` and similar plaintext files

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone and install dependencies
```sh
git clone https://luisapi-admin@bitbucket.org/luisapi/basa-chatbot.git
cd basa-chatbot
composer install
npm install
```

### 2. Environment configuration

```sh
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate
```

Then edit `.env` to configure:

* Laravel app (`APP_URL`, `APP_DEBUG`, etc.)
* Database connection (default: SQLite)
* Queue driver (`QUEUE_CONNECTION=database`)
* LLM model (`LLM_MODEL=tinyllama` or `phi`, etc.)
* Ollama endpoint (`http://localhost:11434`)
* Broadcasting (optional)

### 3. Database setup

```sh
php artisan migrate
```

### 4. Optional: Enable file processing queue

```sh
php artisan queue:table
php artisan migrate
php artisan queue:work
```

### 5. Start servers

```sh
php artisan serve --port=8080
```

Start Ollama and make sure both your chat model and embedding model are installed and running:

```sh
ollama run tinyllama
ollama pull nomic-embed-text
```

> `tinyllama` or similar is used for generating responses.
> `nomic-embed-text` is used for vector embedding in RAG.

Then access: [http://localhost:8080/chatbot](http://localhost:8080/chatbot)

## Composer Dependencies

These packages were added for file parsing and RAG support:

| Package                                                                   | Description                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| [`smalot/pdfparser`](https://github.com/smalot/pdfparser)                 | Extracts text content from PDF files                |
| [`phpoffice/phpword`](https://github.com/PHPOffice/PHPWord)               | Reads `.doc`, `.docx`, `.odt`, and `.rtf` documents |
| [`phpoffice/phpspreadsheet`](https://github.com/PHPOffice/PhpSpreadsheet) | Parses `.xlsx`, `.xls`, `.csv` spreadsheet files    |
| [`laravel/horizon`](https://laravel.com/docs/horizon) *(optional)*        | (Optional) Queue dashboard for Redis (if used)      |

> These allow BASA to process uploaded office documents and extract meaningful context for chunking and embedding.
